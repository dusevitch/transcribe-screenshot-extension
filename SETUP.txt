     * Select "Chrome Extension" as type
     * Copy the Client ID (format: xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com)
   - Open manifest.json in a text editor
   - Replace "YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com" with your actual Client ID
   - Save the file

2. GET GEMINI API KEY

NOTE: Each user needs their own OAuth credentials because Google requires
Chrome extensions to have their OAuth Client ID in the manifest.json file.
