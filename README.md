## Troubleshooting

### "Please set Gemini API key in settings"
- Go to Settings and enter your Gemini API key
- Make sure you copied the entire key from Google AI Studio

### Screenshot capture not working
- Make sure you have permission to access the current tab
- Some browser pages (like `chrome://`) cannot be captured
- Try refreshing the page and trying again

### Transcription errors
- Ensure images contain clear, readable text
- Very large images may take longer to process
- Check your Gemini API quota hasn't been exceeded

### Copy/paste formatting not working
- Try using the download options instead
- HTML and Word formats preserve all formatting

### Download fails
- Check your browser's download settings
- Ensure pop-ups are allowed for the extension
- Try a different format (HTML is most reliable)
